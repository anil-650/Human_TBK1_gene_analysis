# üß¨ Human TBK1 gene analysis
Primary analysis on Human Gene TBK1 using python

## üßæ SUMMARY
- Sequences length = 51225

### üìä Nucleotides distribution:

<!--- Currently using githubs web view and mermaid for chart generation --->

```mermaid
pie showData
   title Nucleotides count in TBK1 gene
   "T" : 16442
   "A" : 15340
   "G" : 10045
   "C" : 9398
```

|Nucleotides|count|
|-|-|
|T | 16442|
|A | 15340|
|G | 10045|
|C | 9398|

### üìâ Seqences found:

- Heavly reapeated sequences varying in length 2 to 5

|Length| Seqns| Count|
|------|------|------|
|2| TT| 3011|
|3| TTT| 868|
|4| TTTT| 308|
|5| TTTTT| 118|

- Seqences with maxmimum length:

|Length| Seqns| Count|
|------|------|------|
|28| CCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTTGGGAGGCCG| 2|

for more details look at [dna_seq_counts.csv](./dna_seq_counts.csv)

## üìù About Script
The [script](./find_seqns.py) was made to perform rudimentary analysis of Human
gene sequences with *python* only using **re**.

### Instructions for using the script

Switch out input file

```py
# find_seqns.py Line 8
# Switch out the file location of the file you want analyzed

# Open and read the DNA sequence file
with open("./Homo_sapiens_TBK1_sequence.fa.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()[1:]
```

Run script

```sh
python find_seqns.py
```
